# Recommender-System
Using the tmdb_5000_movies data and creating a recommender system using the `Weighted Hybrid Technique`.

## W = (Rv + Cm) / (v + M)

Where 
* W = Weighted Rating 
* R = Average for the movie as a number from - to 10 (mean) = Rating 
* m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 3000)
* C = The mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.9) 

## To the end

### Recommender System to find the `Best Movies by average votes` using `Weighted Average Score`.
And a plot representing the `Most Popular Movies by Votes`.


### Recommendation based on scaled weighted and popularity score(Priority is given 50% to both)
And a plot showing the `Best Rated & Most Popular Blend of Movies`.
